 <p>I know you're secretly bored all the time. </p>
  
  <p>Boredom is actually anything but boring. There are entire studies and articles studying boredom. 
  According to some studies, boredom is actually good for you because it helps you to be creative, makes you more productive, 
  and can help you to be a better person.</p>
  
  <p>So, in this site I have include a lot of things which might be described as "boring" and try to get your attention with them. 
  <br>I want to make you "unbored". 
  <br>So let's see how long you can actually stay on without getting bored.
  <br>I challenge you.
  </p>
  <p>Also, for those of you weaklings who get bored easily, I have conveniently located a "Non-Boring" tab to keep those
  individuals interested. However, if that material bores you, then I really have nothing to say. Nothing can satisfy you.</p>

  <p>The most boring part of this website is just to please those who wish to see something that most people are putting in their sites---
  an "About Me" page.
  <br>Here goes.
  <br>I am a sixth grader at Miller Middle school, and next year I will be in seventh grade (hopefully...). 
  Some of my interests include --- and  ---. This is my first time coding in a place like Girls Who Code. 
  I hope you will enjoy my website.
  <br>See what I mean?

  I have always (like, from March-ish of last year) loved Star Wars. The first time I watched A New Hope, I was gaping. 
  When I watched The Force Awakens, I was drooling.
  Now when I have an in-depth Star Wars conversation with somebody, I practically become spastic.
  Here are some of The best quotes from everybody's favorite movies, lo and behold...
