 <p>I know you're secretly bored all the time. </p>
  
  <p>Boredom is actually anything but boring. There are entire studies and articles studying boredom. 
  According to some studies, boredom is actually good for you because it helps you to be creative, makes you more productive, 
  and can help you to be a better person.</p>
  
  <p>So, in this site I have include a lot of things which might be described as "boring" and try to get your attention with them. 
  <br>I want to make you "unbored". 
  <br>So let's see how long you can actually stay on without getting bored.
  <br>I challenge you.
  </p>
  <p>Also, for those of you weaklings who get bored easily, I have conveniently located a "Non-Boring" tab to keep those
  individuals interested. However, if that material bores you, then I really have nothing to say. Nothing can satisfy you.</p>

  <p>Waiting rooms should not even exist.
  <br>Waiting should not exist.
  <br>I know the point of putting boring magazines and lame, unsanitary toys in a waiting room is to make it less boring for those unlucky
  individuals who have to wait for their doctor/dentist/whatever appointment. There is one TV hanging on the wall, and it's usually showing
   something like Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Either that, or weight loss commercials. That is, if you are lucky. Some waiting rooms have an
   old TV that has, like, five channels. 
   <br>The reading material is even worse. There are car magazines from, like, 2005, and beauty magazines. There are weight loss 
   magazines and books of all shapes and sizes. Brochures about what to do if your ten-year-old regularly bedwets. There are board 
   books that have been ripped up by countless filthy fingers. Who knows what sort of bacteria is just breeding and flourishing between the cracks
    of those pages...
   <br>The toys, however, are the worst of all. In the doctors' offices, there are those wire things with about a dozen wooden bead that you 
   move around on the wires. I get the vibe that they are supposed to be fun. However, when I tried to move them around, the fun factor
    could pretty much be described on the same level as watching grass grow.

  <p>The most boring part of this website is just to please those who wish to see something that most people are putting in their sites---
  an "About Me" page.
  <br>Here goes.
  <br>I am a sixth grader at Miller Middle school, and next year I will be in seventh grade (hopefully...). 
  Some of my interests include --- and  ---. This is my first time coding in a place like Girls Who Code. 
  I hope you will enjoy my website.
  <br>See what I mean?

  I have always (like, from March-ish of last year) loved Star Wars. The first time I watched A New Hope, I was gaping. 
  When I watched The Force Awakens, I was drooling.
  Now when I have an in-depth Star Wars conversation with somebody, I practically become spastic.
  Here are some of The best quotes from everybody's favorite movies, lo and behold...
