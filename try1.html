 <p>I know you're secretly bored all the time. </p>
  
  <p>Boredom is actually anything but boring. There are entire studies and articles studying boredom. 
  According to some studies, boredom is actually good for you because it helps you to be creative, makes you more productive, 
  and can help you to be a better person.</p>
  
  <p>So, in this site I have include a lot of things which might be described as "boring" and try to get your attention with them. 
  <br>I want to make you "unbored". 
  <br>So let's see how long you can actually stay on without getting bored.
  <br>I challenge you.
  </p>
  <p>Also, for those of you weaklings who get bored easily, I have conveniently located a "Non-Boring" tab to keep those
  individuals interested. However, if that material bores you, then I really have nothing to say. Nothing can satisfy you.</p>

  <p>I don't think anyone can argue that grammar isn't boring.</p>
  <p>It's a set of rules that tell you how you can and cannot talk. Wouldn't we be much better off if we could just speak as we wanted to?</p>
  <p>The only thing I find remotely interesting about grammar is finding typos and missing apostrophes in books and textbooks that are supposed 
  to be all accurate. I remember, in second grade, being elated to find that the top of a math worksheet read "substraction." I know that's 
  not necessarily grammar, but I like finding other people's flaws.</p>
  <p>In my opinion, part of why most people (including me) find grammar boring is because of its bad reputation. When somebody says grammar, 
  most people think of old teachers with dentures and cobweb hairdos tapping of thick, dusty textbooks with their canes.</p>
  <p>I you still don't find that my ranting makes you feel better sbout learning grammar, then The Oatmeal is a good website to look at. The 
  Oatmeal uses ridiculous sentences and fun drawings to point out the rights and wrongs in grammar.</p>

  <p>Waiting rooms are boring, aren't they?</p>
  <p>Waiting rooms should not even exist.</p>
  <p>Waiting should not exist.</p>
  <p>I know the point of putting boring magazines and lame, unsanitary toys in a waiting room is to make it less boring for those unlucky
  individuals who have to wait for their doctor/dentist/whatever appointment. There is one TV hanging on the wall, and it's usually showing
   something like Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Either that, or weight loss commercials. That is, if you are lucky. Some waiting rooms have an
   old TV that has, like, five channels.</p>
   <p>The reading material is even worse. There are car magazines from, like, 2005, and beauty magazines. There are weight loss 
   magazines and books of all shapes and sizes. Brochures about what to do if your ten-year-old regularly bedwets, and ads about how you 
   should consult your doctor to see if (insert over-the-counter-drug here) is right for you.. There are board 
   books that have been ripped up by countless filthy fingers. Who knows what sort of bacteria is just breeding and flourishing 
   between the cracks
    of those pages...</p>
   <p>The toys, however, are the worst of all. In the doctors' offices, there are those wire things with about a dozen wooden bead that you 
   move around on the wires. I get the vibe that they are supposed to be fun. However, when I tried to move them around, the fun factor
    could pretty much be described on the same level as watching grass grow. There are also grubby monster trucks with wheels that don't work.
  Most of the toys are pretty much useless.

  <p>The most boring part of this website is just to please those who wish to see something that most people are putting in their sites---
  an "About Me" page.
  <br>Here goes.
  <br>I am a sixth grader at Miller Middle school, and next year I will be in seventh grade (hopefully...). 
  Some of my interests include --- and  ---. This is my first time coding in a place like Girls Who Code. 
  I hope you will enjoy my website.
  <br>See what I mean?

<h2>Not boring, this is</h2>


<p>
  I have always (like, from March-ish of last year) loved Star Wars. The first time I watched A New Hope, I was gaping. 
  When I watched The Force Awakens, I was drooling.
  Now when I have an in-depth Star Wars conversation with somebody, I practically become spastic.
  Here are some of The best quotes from everybody's favorite movies, lo and behold...

<h2>If you don't like Star Wars...</h2>
<p>I have conveniently located some interesting fun facts... ABOUT STAR WARS!  Jk.. but still... it's tempting
<br>-Short term memory is actually as short as 15 to 30 seconds 
<br>-The white part on your fingernails is called a lunula, meaning "little moon"
<br>-Otters sleep holding hands
<br>-Twenty percent of office mugs contain fecal matter
<br>-When caterpillars turn into moths, they comepletely liquify
<br>-Green Eggs and Ham, by Dr. Suess, was written as a bet made by his publisher that he couldn't write a book in 50 words or less.
<br>-If Pinochip said, "My nose will grow now" it would be a paradox
<br>-Crocodiles can't chew
<br>-The actor who played Qui-Gon Jinn in The Phantom Menace was too tall for the sets, so the producers spent and additional $150000 
dollars fixing all the doorframes for him (sorry, I couldn't resist putting that in)
<br>-In the original films, the producers of Star Wars physically made their opening crawl (sorry again)
